AI-Driven Financial Advisor

In recent years, individual investors have faced an overwhelming amount of information when trying to make informed trading decisions. News articles, Reddit discussions, social media sentiment, stock fundamentals, and technical indicators all influence market moves — but analyzing these different signals manually is time-consuming, noisy, and error-prone.

We were inspired to create AInvestor because we believe that AI can serve as an intelligent co-pilot for retail investors, combining real-time data collection, sentiment analysis, financial fundamentals, and advanced LLM reasoning into a single, easy-to-use decision engine.

Our product does the following:
1. Aggregate multi-source market data (news, Reddit, Yahoo Finance, technical signals)
2. Apply financial sentiment models (FinBERT) to quantify sentiment
3. Leverage Gemini’s reasoning capabilities to synthesize all factors
4. Generate a professional, explainable Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation

Ultimately, we want AInvestor to be a smart and trustworthy assistant that helps everyday investors cut through the noise and make better investment decisions — quickly, reliably, and confidently.
